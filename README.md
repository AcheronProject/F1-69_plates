# Plate files for Geonworks F1-69

## Introduction

This repository contains the plate files for the Geonworks F1-69 keyboard. The original files, contained in `./resources`, were handed to me by Geon (the keyboard designer) himself with his permission to opensource them.

In `./kicad_files` one will find, well, the KiCad files for the full plate and the half plate. The gerbers for manufacturing can be found in the releases page.

## Licensing

It is important to note that everything in this repository is licensed under the AOHL v1.3 license, which is commercial; however, if one intends to profit from these files I strongly suggest them to contact Geon so as to make sure he knows.
